# 🌿 Weed Detection Using YOLOv8  

This project utilizes **YOLOv8** (You Only Look Once) to detect **weeds in agricultural fields** from images. By leveraging deep learning and computer vision, it provides **real-time, high-accuracy weed detection**, helping farmers optimize crop management by distinguishing between crops and unwanted weeds.

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **YOLOv8-based object detection** for weed identification  
✅ **Bounding box visualization** around detected weeds  
✅ **High-accuracy detection** with confidence scores  
✅ **Real-time processing** for image-based weed detection  
✅ **Displays weed coordinates** to assist in precise localization  

---

## 📌 How It Works  
1️⃣ **Loads an image** containing weeds.  
2️⃣ **Runs the YOLOv8 model** to detect weeds in the image.  
3️⃣ **Filters detections** based on a confidence threshold (0.5).  
4️⃣ **Draws bounding boxes** around detected weeds.  
5️⃣ **Displays additional information** (confidence score, label, coordinates).  
6️⃣ The **final image is displayed** with detected weeds marked.
